## 🎨 Design choices

### Code

#### Steps:

1. Setup the project using Vite (very clean folder structure with no additional useless files);
2. Structure the folders: I've created an initial tree in order to have an initial draft of the project, in order continue to check what to add before to start to code;
3. Packages installation;

### Aesthetic

- **Emojis:** they're a current trend, they're able to give an appealing aesthetic and a kind of a flat and very clean design at the same time

<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->
