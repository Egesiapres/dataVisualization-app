## üí° Design choices

### ‚å®Ô∏è Code

#### Steps:

1. **Setup:** the project setup has been made using *Vite*, a tool that allows you to have a very clean folder structure with no additional useless files, and a light project template
2. **Folder structure:** into the src folder, I've created an initial folder tree in order to have a project draft, to have a high level overview of the project before to start coding
3. **Packages installation:** I've installed the main dependencies the project relies on, such as *Material UI* and *React Router*
4. **Coding:** I've started coding from the routing part, realizing the needed pages one at the time to achieve the correct flow trough the entire app. To realize the dashboard, I took advantage of a template available in the template section of Material UI's webpage that speed up the UI building process. Then, i customized it
5. **Approach:** as React as a framework teaches, I've tried to split the interface into reusable components. This allowed me to save time during the development process, and to be consistent with the "design" choices made

### üé® Aesthetic

- **Colors/UI style:** due to time issues, I've used the default Material UI palette, but I decided to avoid the `outlined` components variant because i found it confusing in some situations, especially when paired with `TextField` components
- **Feedback:** I tried to give feedback/instructions to the user everywhere it was possible, to not leave him alone or without signals
- **Emojis:** I've inserted theme because they're a current trend, they're able to give an appealing aesthetic and a kind of flat and very clean design at the same time. They also set a familiar and not too formal communication style
